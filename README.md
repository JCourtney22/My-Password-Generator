# My-Password-Generator


##Challenges

I really struggle with translating my learning and classes into a task where I then need to apply what I have learnt. I started off writing pseudocode but it felt very vague so I didn't feel that it helped as much as it would have if I were more confident with using Javascrpt. Nevertheless, I looked through my lessons and notes, and used the internet to help me. I eventually was able to recognise how I need to use the function to prompt a user for password options. I realised I needed to use confirm instead of prompt as I only wanted the user to select a true or false response. This then helped me recognise that I would need to eventually use an if statement or something similar.

I was struggling to apply any of my learning to the assignment. So I took a tutor session. This is where I recognised that I needed to call my function correctly and that using parseInt would be helpful. However, I still could not move much further forward on my own after the session. I have managed to get my first prompt to show an alert if the input is incorrect and then the original prompt is shown again, however, I have only managed to get this to do this once. I researched and tried to see how a while loop might work, but again could not make this work so I continued with the if statement.
