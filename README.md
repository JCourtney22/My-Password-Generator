# My-Password-Generator


##Challenges

I really struggle with translating my learning and classes into a task where I then need to apply what I have learnt. I started off writing pseudocode but it felt very vague so I didn't feel that it helped as much as it would have if I were more confident with using Javascrpt. Nevertheless, I looked through my lessons and notes, and used the internet to help me. I eventually was able to recognise how I need to use the function to prompt a user for password options. I realised I needed to use confirm instead of prompt as I only wanted athe user to select a true or false response. This then helped me recognise that I would need to eventually use an if statement.
