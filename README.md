# My-Password-Generator

Despite having a tutor session and support from other students, I have found this project extremely difficult and, at present, the password generator does not work as intended as a password does not print to the screen. However, I still wanted to share my code as I have worked hard to get something coded. I feel that this still holds value in regards to my determination and recognition of my own strengths and weaknesses.

I hope to develop my understanding of Javascript so that I may come back to this assignment and eventually get it working.

##Challenges

I really struggle with translating my learning and classes into a task where I then need to apply what I have learnt. I started off writing pseudocode but it felt very vague so I didn't feel that it helped as much as it would have if I were more confident with using Javascrpt. Nevertheless, I looked through my lessons and notes, and used the internet to help me. I eventually was able to recognise how I need to use the function to prompt a user for password options. I realised I needed to use confirm instead of prompt as I only wanted the user to select a true or false response. This then helped me recognise that I would need to eventually use an if statement or something similar.

I was struggling to apply any of my learning to the assignment. So I took a tutor session. This is where I recognised that I needed to call my function correctly and that using parseInt would be helpful. However, I still could not move much further forward on my own after the session. I have managed to get my first prompt to show an alert if the input is incorrect and then the original prompt is shown again, however, I have only managed to get this to do this once. I researched and tried to see how a while loop might work, but again could not make this work so I continued with the if statement.

I really struggled to understand how to apply any of my Javascript to the assignment. I worked with another student who gave me some hints as to what I needed to include. This made me realise that I needed to create a variables that I can that access to then allow me to push into an array depending on user choice. This is where I then applied an if statement to push into the array and I decided not to use parseInt. However, I could not get the input number between 10 and 64 to loop more than once back despite looking at do and while loops. Additionally, I do not know how to put in an if statement that brings up an alert to tell the user they must select at least one type of character.


##Things I learned

I have learnt that being a visual learner makes using and understanding Javascript very difficult. As some outcomes only appear once the code is written correctly, I could not identify where I was going wrong or what I needed. This made me realise that I need more time to build my skills steadily instead of attempting to research lots of things without fully udnerstanding how they work.

I have also learnt that there is value in seeking support from others. My tutor session was only slightly helpful because I also did not know where to start nor did I know what I didn't know. A student gave me small snippets of their code to look at and some hints, which I could have easily have copied and extended. However, I took this as an opportunity to explore how the code could work as I am aware that there are several ways of getting the right solution. I used this alongside my current understanding an additional reasearch. Thus, I was able to extend my understanding of scope and calling to variables and functions.
